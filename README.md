**This project is in progress.**

This is a crate that generates bindings using the C SDK for PY32F0. Currently, installing `arm-none-eabi-gcc` is required to use this library. Use `arm-none-eabi-gcc -v` in cmd to verify the installation.

**TODO:**

- Precompilation
- Macro functions
- Handling macros with type conversions（https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/pull/2369）
